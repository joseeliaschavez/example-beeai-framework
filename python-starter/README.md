## 📋 Requirements

- **Python Version 3.11+**
- **Poetry Version 2.0+** for Python package management - See [installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) 
- **Container system** (with Compose support):
    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
    - [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) (For macOS, use VZ instead of QEMU)
    - [Podman](https://podman.io/) (Requires [Compose](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/compose/setting-up-compose) and rootful machine)
- **LLM Provider** - External [WatsonX](https://www.ibm.com/watsonx) (OpenAI, Groq, ...) or local [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
- **IDE/Code Editor** (e.g., WebStorm, VSCode) - Optional but recommended for smooth smooth configuration handling

## 🛠️ Installation

**Step 1:** Clone this repository or [use it as a template](https://github.com/new?template_name=beeai-framework-py-starter&template_owner=i-am-bee)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework-py-starter.git
cd beeai-framework-py-starter
```

**Step 2:** Install dependencies
```sh
poetry install
```

**Step 3:** Install and start the poetry environment
```sh
poetry self add poetry-plugin-shell
poetry shell
```

**Step 4:** Create an `.env` file with the contents from `.env.template`

**Step 5:** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) must be installed and running, with the granite3.3 model pulled.
```sh
ollama pull granite3.3
```

**Step 6:** Start all services related to [beeai-code-interpreter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-code-interpreter)
```sh
poe infra --type start
```

> [!NOTE]
> beeai-code-interpreter runs on `http://127.0.0.1:50081`

## 🔎 Observability

Get complete visibility of the agent's inner workings via [OpenInference Instrumentation for BeeAI](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/tree/main/python/instrumentation/openinference-instrumentation-beeai).

> Be sure the [OpenInference Instrumentation for BeeAI](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/tree/main/python/instrumentation/openinference-instrumentation-beeai) supports the newest [BeeAI framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework/tree/main/python) before updating the framework version in this repository.

### Instructions

1. (Optional) In order to see spans in [Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix), begin running a Phoenix server. This can be done in one command using docker.

```
docker run -p 6006:6006 -i -t arizephoenix/phoenix
```

or via the command line:

```
brew install i-am-bee/beeai/arize-phoenix
brew services start arize-phoenix
```

see https://docs.beeai.dev/observability/agents-traceability for more details.

2. Run the agent `python beeai_framework_starter/agent_observe.py`
3. You should see your spans exported in your console. If you've set up a locally running Phoenix server, head to [**localhost:6006**](http://localhost:6006/projects) to see your spans.

## 💡 Examples
 
### 🤖 Agent

Now that you’ve set up your project, let’s run the agent example located at `/beeai_framework_starter/agent.py`.

You have two options:

**Option 1:** Interactive mode
```sh
python beeai_framework_starter/agent.py
```

**Option 2:** Define your prompt up front
```sh
python beeai_framework_starter/agent.py <<< "I am going out tomorrow morning to walk around Boston. What should I plan to wear?"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Notice this prompts triggers the agent to call a tool.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Code interpreter agent

Now let's run the code interpreter agent example located at `/beeai_framework_starter/agent_code_interpreter.py`.

Try the `Python Tool` and ask the agent to perform a complex calculation:
```sh
python beeai_framework_starter/agent_code_interpreter.py <<< "Calculate 534*342?"
```

Try the `SandBox tool` and run a custom Python function `get_riddle()`:
```sh
python beeai_framework_starter/agent_code_interpreter.py <<< "Generate a riddle"
```

---

### 🌐 Multi-agent workflow

This example demonstrates a **multi-agent workflow** where different agents work together to provide a comprehensive understanding of a location.

The workflow includes three agents:
1. **Researcher:** Gathers information about the location using the Wikipedia tool.
2. **WeatherForecaster:** Retrieves and reports weather details using the OpenMeteo API.
3. **DataSynthesizer:** Combines the historical and weather data into a final summary.

To run the workflow:
```sh
python beeai_framework_starter/agent_workflow.py
```
